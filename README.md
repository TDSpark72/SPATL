 SPATL – Simulation of Power Analysis in Transmission Lines

SPATL (Simulation of Power Analysis in Transmission Lines) is a Python-based project designed to analyze short, medium, and long transmission lines.
It provides a complete framework for simulating, calculating, and visualizing the performance of transmission lines using mathematical models and user-friendly tools.

📌 INTRODUCTION

Transmission lines form the backbone of power systems, and their behavior directly impacts voltage stability, efficiency, and power quality.
This project aims to bridge the gap between theoretical models and practical analysis by simulating all three types of lines:

1.Short Line

2.Medium Line

3.Long Line
SPATL allows users to input real-world parameters, run simulations, and obtain numerical as well as graphical outputs, making it an ideal educational and research tool.

🚀 Features

5.Graphical Outputs – Line charts & bar graphs for better visualization
6.Extendable to fault analysis and smart grid studies

🛠️ Methodology

1. User Input – Line length, resistance (R), inductance (L), capacitance (C), conductance (G), sending end voltage, power factor, etc.
2. Model Selection – Based on line length: Short, Medium, or Long.
3. Calculations – Apply ABCD models (lumped, nominal
